Title: Human Attention Mechanism 

In this blog, I want to write up some of my inspiration regarding the attention mechanism. I used to hold some questions as to give a certain period of time, why it is likely that an experienced staff is able to have a better performance than a newbie. Reading through the machine learning materials recently, I try to associate it with the space state -- In Reinforcement Learning, there is a concept called space state which refers to the action/observation. It can be understood like the choices (for action) and affairs that might be happening (for observation). It is acknowledged that human's energy is limited because of which we have to spend time doing the most seemingly right things. Utilizing such a mechansim, we can understand it like the experienced staff has done it before (having explored the action/observation states) and thereof he would not choose to explore what he considered the wrong/unnecessary states again for the next time, paying his attention on the unexplored states. While for a novel, he would be likely spending time and efforts on the pitfall (wrong/unnecessary states) without prior knowledge about it.
