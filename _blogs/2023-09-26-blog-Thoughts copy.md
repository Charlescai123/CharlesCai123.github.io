Title: Thinkings about feeling of beauty of math formula

Recently I've been thinking about my feelings towards the math formula. I remember when I was at undergrad, I was full of interest to learning all the math and physics formula. However, when I got enrolled as PhD, it seems my enthusiasm towards them has decreased a lot. I was trying to think about the potential reasons. I found that maybe I grow up by experiencing different kinds of stuffs, and I got to know the uncertainties existing in real life -- What is certain in life is the uncertainties. Holding such a thought, I found myself lost the confidence of these formula. I used to love them because they can be used to predict the future within what we know and obtained at the current moment. I think they're authoritative and sacred. But the truth is -- they are found through the method called induction, and they're actually the ideal assumptions about the world. While the world is not a perfect model, it is involved with a lot of noises (uncertainties). I cannot make sure the prediction is 100% correct with these formula. That's the reason I, as a perfectionism, soon lost the interest to them after realizing all of facts. 

I believe I'll need to build some new insights to reconstruct my thinking towards the world and rediscover the lost ethusiasm for these formula.
