Title: Thoughts about the my lifegoal

I coincidently discover the words on the internet and I just thought they may be used to describe my lifegoal. These words are **Hacker**, **Geek**, **Maker** and **Witkey**, respectively. Here are my understanding for each of them:

**Hacker**: Someone highly skilled in computers, driven by a strong desire to challenge conventional rules in the world. Fearless of authority, they aim to employ their technical expertise as a tool to confront injustices in any forms;

**Geek**: An ardent fan of technologies. They are captivated by the transformative power of technology in shaping human lives and dedicate themselves to mastering various technical knowledge and skills to enhance the quality of life;

**Maker**: Similar to **Geek**, but but their primary focus lies in hands-on, do-it-yourself experiences. They are crazy about innovation and cratfing from scratch. They emphasize the practical skills and aspire to apply their creations into real-life applications;

**Witkey**: The one who earns money by offering his skills and services to others through various platforms. He also has a strong affinity for technical skills, but, above all, he hopes that these skills can yield economic benefits to demonstrate their value for him;

I aspire to pursue the following paths on my life journey: Embracing the hacker spirit to address injustices, embodying the geek mentality with a wealth of knowledge and a dedicated approach to engineering and science, engaging in maker-like activities to gain hands-on experience, and ultimately evolving into a witkey to establish my own brand or company for financial success.
