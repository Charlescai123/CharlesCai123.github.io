Title: Learning Method For A PhD

===

Generally speaking, Undergrad/Master is learning-oriented but PhD is problem-oriented. What we are dealt with in undergrad and master is learning a whole theory of a specific field and then use it or some of it to solve the practical problem. However during PhD, this serves as an inverse approach -- The knowledge is scatterly distributed and you may learn whatever is needed by searching the literature online yourself. You don't need to complete a learning throughly but discover all the parts essential to the problem you're trying to solve or improve. That being said, the research ability isn't a relationship linear to the knowledge you've mastered. Instead, it relates to your ability of knowledge acquisition and integration, and how you can leverage them to your project.
